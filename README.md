# ACTS: AD Clinical Trial Simulation

## Group Overview

This is a MPI project funded by NIH Grant R01AG084236 to develop advanced informatics approaches for an Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trial Simulation System

## AIMs

In this study, we will create a framwork that clinical investigators can leverage for clinical trial simulation studies: 

1. Clinical trial eligibility criteria need to be represented in a formal and standard way that is compatible with EHR standards to retrieve the needed patient cohorts and associated patient phenotypes from EHR.

2. A comprehensive pipeline and associated tools need to be implemented that could seamlessly align with large-scale EHR data.
